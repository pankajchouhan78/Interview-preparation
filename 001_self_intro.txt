Hello, my name is Pankaj Chouhan. I’m from Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, and I have 2+ years of experience as a backend developer.

I specialize in Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Flask, and FastAPI. On the frontend side, I have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. 

In terms of databases, I have worked with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. 

In terms of cloud technologies, I have experience with AWS and its services such as EC2, RDS, and S3.

(I also have hands-on experience with DevOps and deployment processes, including Docker and CI/CD pipelines, which I have used for automated testing and deployment.)

Additionally, I have experience with Git, GitHub and GitLab for version control.

Currently, I am working as a Python Developer at Bridgefix Technologies, Indore, with 1.5+ year of hands-on experience. My role involves developing backend systems and APIs using Django, DRF, and FastAPI, and working with tools such as Docker, PostgreSQL, Celery, and Redis. 

Previously/Prior to this, I worked at ITGeeks Technologies in Dewas as a PHP Trainee, where I gained hands-on experience in PHP, Laravel, and Shopify. During this time, I contributed to developing an e-commerce platform, optimizing performance, and integrating third-party APIs.

Regarding projects/If I talk about my projects, I have worked on multiple projects, including Third I, Procurement, and orchid.

(Apart from my technical skills, I am a quick learner with strong problem-solving and logical thinking abilities.)

That’s all from my side. Thank you.
