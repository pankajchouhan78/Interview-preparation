2. Project: ProcureMate (AI-based Tender Management Platform)

ProcureMate is an AI-based tender management platform built for petroleum companies like Bharat Petroleum and Indian Oil. 

The platform allows multiple vendors to apply for multiple tenders by submitting their bids and required documents. such as asset availability, financial strength, and past experience. 

All bid data is processed by an AI system that evaluates bids in three steps, such as eligibility checks, financial and technical comparison, and final shortlisting.

It also automates tender listing, bid submission, and compliance document handling.This helps in selecting the most suitable vendor and makes the tender process faster, transparent, and efficient.


My Responsibilities:
In this project, my responsibilities were:
1. Developing  backend APIs using FastAPI for vendor registration, tender listings, and bid submissions.
2. Designing and managing the relational database schema on AWS RDS.
3. Implementing AWS S3 for secure storage and access of large compliance documents.
4. Deploying the application on AWS EC2 and setting up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
