1. Tell us about yourself.
2. What motivated you to become a software developer? | What motivated you to become a software developer?
I like solving problems and working with technology. I was interested in programming because it is logical and structured. Later, I understood that through software development, we can build useful applications that help people in real life. I enjoy learning new technologies and creating smart and efficient solutions, and that’s why I chose software development as my caree

3. Why did you choose to specialize in backend development?
I enjoy working with data, designing systems, and solving complex problems that happen behind the scenes. Backend development allows me to focus on solutions.

4. What is your greatest strength and weakness?
- My greatest strength is my problem-solving ability. When I face a bug or complex requirement, I stay calm and try to understand the root cause before jumping to a solution. I also keep learning new things to improve my backend skills.
- One weakness I have is that earlier I hesitated to ask questions and tried to solve everything on my own. This sometimes took more time. Now I make sure to communicate early if I’m stuck, which helps me work more efficiently.

5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
In five years, I see myself as a senior developer. I want to take more responsibility, guide junior developers, and work on more complex backend projects. I also want to keep learning new technologies and improve my skills so I can add more value to the company.

Technical Skills & Experience:
1. Can you explain your experience with [Python/Django/Flask/other tech stack mentioned]?
"I have extensive experience working with Python, particularly in backend development using Django and Flask. I’ve used Django for building robust web applications and RESTful APIs with Django Rest Framework. I’m also comfortable working with Flask for smaller projects where simplicity and flexibility are more important. I’ve built multiple APIs, integrated third-party services, and optimized the performance of applications using these frameworks."

2. Describe a project you’ve worked on where you built a RESTful API.
"In my current role, I worked on building a RESTful API for a customer management system. I used Django Rest Framework to create the API endpoints for managing customer data, orders, and payments. The project required implementing authentication with JWT tokens and ensuring the API could handle large volumes of requests efficiently. I also added caching to improve response times for frequently accessed data and used versioning to maintain backward compatibility with previous API versions."

3. What is the difference between Django and Flask? When would you choose one over the other?
- Django is a full web framework that comes with many built-in features like an admin panel, authentication, and database tools. It is good for large or complex projects where you need many features ready to use.
- Flask is a lightweight framework. It gives more flexibility but does not include many built-in features. You have to add things based on your needs.
- FastAPI is modern and very fast. It is mainly used for building APIs. It supports async programming and automatic API documentation. It is a good choice when you need high performance and are building REST APIs or microservices.
- I would choose Django for large projects where I want faster development with ready-made features. I would choose Flask for smaller projects or when I need more control and customization. I would choose FastAPI when building high-performance APIs.

4. How do you ensure the performance of an API?
"To ensure the performance of an API, I focus on optimizing database queries, using pagination for large data sets, and applying caching for frequently requested resources. I also ensure that the API is designed to handle high traffic by using rate limiting and load balancing techniques. In addition, I profile the API to identify bottlenecks and use tools like Django Debug Toolbar to monitor and improve query performance."

5. What strategies do you use for debugging and troubleshooting in your projects?
"I typically start by checking error logs to identify any obvious issues. I also use logging in the code to trace specific problems. When debugging, I use tools like Python's pdb debugger and breakpoints to step through the code. If the issue is related to a database, I check the queries and use Django’s query logging to identify inefficient queries. I also rely on unit testing to isolate issues and ensure that changes don’t break existing functionality."

6. Can you explain how you’ve used Git in your workflow?
- If I talk about my Git workflow, in my daily work I use Git to track code changes and work with my team. I create separate branches for new features or bug fixes. I commit my changes regularly with clear messages so others can understand what I did.
- Before merging my code into the main branch, I create a pull request so the team can review it. After approval, the code is merged. I also pull the latest changes from the main branch to keep my code updated.

7. What is your experience with Docker and containerization?
- If I talk about my experience with Docker, I have used it to containerize applications so they run the same in every environment. In my current role, I use Docker to set up development and production environments for backend applications. This helps avoid environment-related issues and makes deployment easier.
- I have also used Docker Compose to manage multiple containers together, like running the backend application, database, Celery worker, and Redis in separate containers. This makes the setup simple, organized, and consistent for the whole team.

8. How do you ensure the security of web applications?
"I follow best security practices like validating all user inputs to prevent invalid or harmful data. I implement proper authentication and authorization to make sure only authorized users can access specific resources. I also store passwords in hashed form, never in plain text, to protect user data.

9. What’s your experience with databases like MySQL?
- If I talk about my database experience, I have worked with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite in both personal and professional projects. I have designed relational databases and handled migrations.
- I am comfortable writing SQL queries, including complex ones. I also work on query optimization, indexing, and proper normalization to improve performance. In Django projects, I mostly use Django ORM for database operations, but I can also write raw SQL queries when needed.

10. How do you optimize database queries for better performance?
- To optimize database queries, I first check for slow queries. I add indexes on fields that are frequently searched or filtered. I also make sure queries fetch only the required columns instead of unnecessary data.
- I use proper joins to combine related tables in a single query instead of running multiple queries. In Django, I use select_related, which works like a SQL join, to reduce extra database calls.
- For large data sets, I use pagination so we don’t load everything at once. I also use caching to reduce repeated database hits.

1. Why are you looking for a job change?
I’m looking for a change mainly for better career growth, skill growth, and financial growth. I want to work on more challenging backend projects using Python, Django, and REST APIs so that my technical skills keep improving and I can add more value. I’m also looking for a role where my contribution and skills are reflected in my compensation, so I can grow both professionally and financially.

2. What are you expecting from your next job?
I’m expecting a role where I can work on real backend development using Python, Django/Flask/FastAPI. I also want to keep learning new technologies, grow in a stable and supportive environment.

3. Why do you want to leave your current company?
I’m grateful for the experience I’ve gained at my current company. I’m now looking for better career growth and financial growth, and a role where I can take on more challenging backend work, learn new technologies.
That’s why I’m exploring opportunities that align with my goals.

3. I’m ready to make the move after breaking the bond. I would need around 7 to 15 days to complete the basic formalities and prepare for the transition. I can assure you that I’m fully committed and can join within that time frame.

Behavioral Questions:
1. Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with a team member. How did you resolve it?
"In one project, a team member and I disagreed on the architecture of an API. I believed that a more modular approach would be better for future scalability, but they argued for a simpler solution. To resolve the disagreement, we scheduled a meeting to discuss the pros and cons of each approach, and we also reviewed some documentation and best practices. Eventually, we compromised by adopting a modular approach but keeping it simple initially. This allowed us to scale the solution later without significant refactoring."

2. Give an example of when you had to handle multiple tasks or projects. How did you manage your time?
"When juggling multiple tasks, I prioritize based on deadlines and the impact of each task. I use tools like Jira or Trello to track progress and set clear milestones for each project. I also break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces to ensure steady progress. If there’s a conflict between projects, I communicate with the team to adjust priorities and deadlines. This method helps me stay organized and ensures that nothing falls through the cracks."
