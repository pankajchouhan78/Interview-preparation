Behavioral Questions:
1. Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with a team member. How did you resolve it?
"In one project, a team member and I disagreed on the architecture of an API. I believed that a more modular approach would be better for future scalability, but they argued for a simpler solution. To resolve the disagreement, we scheduled a meeting to discuss the pros and cons of each approach, and we also reviewed some documentation and best practices. Eventually, we compromised by adopting a modular approach but keeping it simple initially. This allowed us to scale the solution later without significant refactoring."

2. Give an example of when you had to handle multiple tasks or projects. How did you manage your time?
"When juggling multiple tasks, I prioritize based on deadlines and the impact of each task. I use tools like Jira or Trello to track progress and set clear milestones for each project. I also break down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces to ensure steady progress. If there’s a conflict between projects, I communicate with the team to adjust priorities and deadlines. This method helps me stay organized and ensures that nothing falls through the cracks."
